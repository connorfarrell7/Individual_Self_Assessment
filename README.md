# Individual Self Assessment

## Self Assessment
For the first deliverable, i was the square role, meaning that i was in charge of setting up and making sure the github repository was working for everyoe. I helped with the readme.md file to help describe our goals, and helped establish a communication protocol for the group. For the second deliverable, I was the circle role, meaning i was in charge of creating visualizations of the data set. We decided as a group to use Tableau to create our dashboard, and i made three graphs to use in our final presentation. For the thrid and fourth deliverables, i was the circle role again, but most of the work our group did for these two deliverables was focused on finalizing our slides and deciding what we were going to be saying in our presentation.

### Team Assessment
Our team was very good at getting their individual responsibilities completed in a timely fashion. We always had a good amount of time to make sure everything was done well, and we did not struggle to meet any deadlines. One thing we could have done differently would to have been more involved in each other's roles, and worked a bit more colaboratively. We used a Slack group to communicate with each other, and outside of the class zoom sessions, we met on several occasions over zoom to work on the project. 

#### Project Summary
Our goal was to create a machine learning model to predict whether or not a student would be accepted into an internship program based on the factors that were available in the dataset. We built a classification model - a subcategory of supervised machine learning - that was able to give us an 86% accuracy result.
